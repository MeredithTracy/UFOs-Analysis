# UFOs Analysis

## Overview of Project
We have been tasked with assisting Dana to create a clean and clear webpage to display her data on UFO sightings around with world. She wanted her data in a table that could be filtered down to make it easier to use. Using JavaScript, we have created a webpage that Dana can use to present her article and her findings. 


## Results and Search Process

The way we have set up our webpage allows for a user to first read Dana’s article then begin their own search. This flow allows for Dana’s article to be the focus. Then we move into the filter search boxes. The user can search under any of the following fields: Date, City, State, Country, or Shape. Whichever filter they use will pull up a table of any matching UFO sightings. They will be able to read all the above listed information as well as the duration and comments about the sighting. 


## Summary
One drawback to this design is that it is case sensitive to the data that was provided, which means city names are lowercase. If you use uppercase or misspell a town name, it is unable to find the data. 
We could make edits to have the search bar recognize upper and lowercase for the city, state, and country filters. We could also create a dropdown menu of options for the shape filter to make it a bit easier since those are descriptive words and people may search under one word but our data lists it as a different word. We could also have the search box clear after entering our search input to make it a bit clearer for the user as well.
